				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Markus &#8220;Traumflug&#8221; Hitter</p>
<p>One might think that displaying and calculating prices is of stellar importance for e-commerce. Selling goods is all about finding the right price for the customer, displaying it nicely next to the product and adding it up correctly for the cart an the invoice, after all. And then a <u><a href="https://github.com/thirtybees/thirtybees/issues/795">bug report came in</a></u> which made me scratch my head a bit. A matured e-commerce software like thirty bees, but rounding in the cart was plain wrong. Total of the product didn&#8217;t even match the cart total.</p>
<p>Long story short, this report triggered an audit of all the price rounding done throughout the code. Result is not only rounding fixed, but all the nice features around price display, like displaying 3 or 4 digits after the decimal, like displaying prices without any decimals, actually working. Let&#8217;s see what we have, and feel invited to try this in other e-commerce solutions.</p>
<h2>Rounding per item</h2>
<p>Try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Back office -&gt; <em>Preferences</em> -&gt; <em>General</em>, set <em>Round mode</em> to <em>&#8220;Round up away from zero&#8221;</em> and <em>Round type</em> to <em>&#8220;Round on each item&#8221;</em>.</li>
<li>In the same place, set <em>Number of decimals</em> to 2.</li>
<li>Edit a product to have a pre-tax retail price of 9.55 and apply a tax rule with 22%.</li>
<li>Go to <em>Customers</em> -&gt; <em>Groups</em> and give group <em>Visitor</em> a general discount of 5%</li>
<li>Visit the shop as a customer and add 24 items of said product to the cart.</li>
<li>View the cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>One should see this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3710 size-full" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/24-Candles.png" alt="" width="431" height="275" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/24-Candles-200x128.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/24-Candles-300x191.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/24-Candles-400x255.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/24-Candles.png 431w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></p>
<p>No surprise? That&#8217;s correct, after all. Well, earlier one might well have seen <u><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/24-Candles-1.0.8.png">this</a></u>.</p>
<h2>Price precision</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s another experiment. The graphics below is a compilation of cropped screenshots.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Number of decimals</em> can be found in back office -&gt; <em>Preferences</em> -&gt; <em>General</em>.</li>
<li><em>Decimals</em> can be found in back office -&gt; <em>Localization</em> -&gt; <em>Currency</em>, then clicking on  of a currency. Which means, it&#8217;s a per-currency setting and can vary between currencies.</li>
<li>Right column are screenshots from front office.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3718" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Display.png" alt="" width="650" height="392" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Display-200x121.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Display-300x181.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Display-400x241.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Display-600x362.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Display.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Again, while such an outcome should be a matter of course, this wasn&#8217;t always the case. Take the liberty to try with your current installation, or with PrestaShop.</p>
<h2>Price display in back office</h2>
<p>Price display in back office was audited as well. Some fields were always cropped to two digits after the decimal, others always to 6 digits, having a lot of trailing zeros.</p>
<p>New strategy is to show at least the configured number of digits, but to allow more. As this series of cropped screenshots shows:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3721 aligncenter" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Input.png" alt="" width="150" height="518" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Input-87x300.png 87w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-Price-Input.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>Number of decimals was set to 2, then prices of 10, 10.1, 10.12, 10.123 &#8230; 10.123456, 10.1234567 were inserted. As one can see, exceeding the maximum number of 6 digits after the decimal gets rounded.</p>
<p>Happy trading with thirty bees, now with precise prices!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It started its life as the Git Updater module, but we wanted to come up with a name that would have a better explanation of what the module accomplishes. Nothing is more frustrating than coming across a term you do not know, or a module that you do not know what does. So we have changed the name of the Git Updater to the Core Updater module.</p>
<p>This is the same module that you, our community crowd funded. This is the module that will make updates for versions of thirty bees quick and painless from today forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The module</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks ago we released the first beta, since then the module has went through several iterations before it became stable enough to release. We took the feedback from the community and added a few new features to the module, like excluding the theme and better reporting of what was going on. From that we (I saw we, but it was @traumflug or Markus) made the changes and the module as a whole. Now the module has been released and is on our store to help you update to the latest version of thirty bees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>As we have said many times before, it is our community that makes us great. If you are just finding thirty bees and like the idea of our new core updater module, below is the list of people that donated to make this module possible.</p>
<p>Tanguy JACQUET<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its been a while since the crowd funding of the Git Updater module finished. Don&#8217;t worry, we did not forget about the module, we have actually made some great progress with the module and are ready to start sharing the beta version of the module. The Git Updater module will usher in a new era of thirty bees. Since many people are not familiar with how the update process works, let me explain it a bit.</p>
<p>In the current update process to update thirty bees, we need to create what are called file actions. We have a huge list of file actions for every file in the thirty bees repository. This list needs to be updated on every release. So in the end, we end up with a list of different version, which you can see on our current api here,  <a href="https://api.thirtybees.com/updates/channels/stable.json"><strong>https://api.thirtybees.com/updates/channels/stable.json</strong></a>  which download the whole thirty bees package, and use the list of file actions that are manually generated that you see here, <a href="https://api.thirtybees.com/updates/packs/thirtybees-file-actions-v1.0.8.json"><strong>https://api.thirtybees.com/updates/packs/thirtybees-file-actions-v1.0.8.json</strong></a></p>
<p>It currently takes about a day to build and package a release this way. Essentially what is being done with our current updater, is re-inventing the wheel. This system is bulky, it comes with a lot of overhead, and is quite slow. There really is not need to download the whole package of thirty bees if only 100 files are being updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introducing the Git Updater module</h2>
<p>This is the module that our loyal community brought to life with crowd funding. It is nearing completion and has already started being beta tested on our forum. So far the feedback for the module has been great, it is working as it should, and it is working amazingly fast. The module actually gives a lot more flexibility than any other updater module.</p>
<p>Bugs are a fact of software. Nothing is more frustrating than updating and introducing a new show stopping bug. It is complicated and time consuming to restore, or roll back to the previous version of the software that does not have the bug.</p>
<p>Whats even worse than this scenario? When there is a bug that the new version fixes, but a bug it adds, then the day after the release the new bug is fixed. This means you either live with one bug until the next release, or you have to figure out how to manually add the patch.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about these scenarios? One, because they are very common in software, the second is because this is exactly what the new Git Updater fixes. Lets take a look at the new module. Installed the new module looks like the image below.</p>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3688" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed.png" alt="git updater installed" width="998" height="78" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed-200x16.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed-300x23.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed-400x31.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed-600x47.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed-768x60.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed-800x63.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-installed.png 998w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" /></a></p>
<p>The module does not use a configuration screen like most modules, it adds a new menu item to the side navigation. The main reason is we want to move things off of the module page.</p>
<p>When you open the module, this is what you are currently presented with.</p>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3689" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen.png" alt="git updater screen" width="1353" height="390" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-200x58.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-300x86.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-400x115.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-600x173.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-768x221.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-800x231.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-1024x295.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen-1200x346.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-screen.png 1353w" sizes="(max-width: 1353px) 100vw, 1353px" /></a></p>
<p>The module interface is pretty simple, all you have to do is select the version of thirty bees that you want to upgrade or downgrade to, then click the compare button. The compare button uses our git mirror to check which files have been changed between the two versions and outputs a list. You can see this below.</p>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3690" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare.png" alt="git updater compare" width="1333" height="559" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-200x84.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-300x126.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-400x168.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-600x252.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-768x322.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-800x335.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-1024x429.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare-1200x503.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-compare.png 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /></a></p>
<p>You can see from the image that between version 1.0.5 and version 1.0.8 of thirty bees there have been 913 file changes, 109 new files have been added, 95 files need to be deleted, and there are 11 files that should not be in the installation.</p>
<p>If you look at the first image, you can also see there are versions that you can select from. Like below.</p>
<p><a href="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3691" src="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily.png" alt="git updater daily" width="1352" height="391" srcset="https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-200x58.png 200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-300x87.png 300w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-400x116.png 400w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-600x174.png 600w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-768x222.png 768w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-800x231.png 800w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-1024x296.png 1024w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily-1200x347.png 1200w, https://thirtybees.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/git-updater-daily.png 1352w" sizes="(max-width: 1352px) 100vw, 1352px" /></a></p>
<p>This means as soon as there is a bug fix, you can deploy it to your shop. This setting lets you use the latest commits from the repository, before a build is made, making it truly a bleeding edge. Now, this is only recommended for merchants or developers that know what they are doing, but it does give you the option to be as up to date as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All of these reasons are why we are pushing development of this module so heavily. It will allow merchants and developers to be able to upgrade, downgrade, and patch their shops in the most effective ways, allowing them to focus on selling and not finding a developer to manage their shop.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last year, I expressed that I wanted to make the integration of the community and thirty bees to be more fluid. Launching our new forum is the first step in to making that a reality. Not only is it easier to administrate, it is also a lot easier to build upon for the new features we are wanting to add in the future.</p>
<p>Our previous forum was built off of Nodebb, while it did have some nice features, it was very troublesome to maintain. Everything we tried to use for it was half developed, so this made it where we had to maintain some of the integrations ourselves, integrations that were standard in other platforms. It was also built on a stack that we were largely unfamiliar with, Node, Mongodb, and Solr. This only added to the frustrations with the forum.</p>
<h2>The Migration</h2>
<p>We migrated everything from the old forum, with one exception. We did not migrate the private messages from the old forum. We did not do this, because we had to migrate everything by hand. We had to write custom migration scripts, then check to see if everything was migrated correctly. If we migrated the private messages, we would have to had read some of them to make sure things migrated correctly. So we decided to just abandon them to the graveyard of the old platform, because like you, we value privacy.</p>
<h2>Blogs</h2>
<p>The blogs are one of my favorite features of the new forum. Last year when I started looking at the different forum choices, that was a feature I wanted in the core. So many good tips and tricks to using thirty bees get buried by having them as posts. With each user being able to have their own blogs, we can keep some of our great mods and tricks where they are easier seen. This should help new users who are trying to find information about how to modify their shops. You can <a href="https://forum.thirtybees.com/blogs/entry/1-creating-your-blog/"><strong>view a quick tutorial on how to use the blogs here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Another great way to use the blogs is to post information about modules you have created. This will allow people on our forums to discover your modules easier when you post content to our forum. You can write how to articles about your modules, tutorials, or other informative information and highlight it to the thirty bees community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Coming Soon to the Forum</h2>
<p>There were a couple of features we were working on that are not quite ready for prime time before the launch. But will be coming shortly to the forum. Some of those features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flair for Patrons and supporters of thirty bees</li>
<li>Flair for partner agencies</li>
<li>Feeds from our store to module sellers profiles</li>
<li>Feature requests</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a couple of other features in mind as well. We hope to use the new forum to better tie in the community and better educate our users.</p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>There could still be a few layout or other bugs left on the forum. If you notice any, please <a href="https://forum.thirtybees.com/topic/2469-new-forum-has-launched/"><strong>post them to this thread.</strong></a> We will get them handled as quickly as we can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we are proud to announce thirty bees newest partner agency idnovate. idnovate is a full service agency thirty bees based in Barcelona Spain. idnovate specializes in modules, but they are also a full service thirty bees agency. They are trained in both front end design and back end development, making them a great agency to handle all of your thirty bees needs. If you are looking for a great agency to help with your next project, look no further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>idnovate modules</h2>
<p>idnovate has an extensive module library that is compatible with thirty bees. Currently they have almost 60 modules modules that add a wide range of features to thirty bees. Most of their modules fall into two classes, payment modules and front office features. This is not the limit to their modules though, they offer shipping modules, modules deisgned to make the administration of your shop easier, and price management modules. Below are some of their most popular modules.</p>
<h3>Promotions and Discounts</h3>
<p>This module allows you to offer many different types of promotions and discounts that are not available in the standard thirty bees package. You can define discounts like buy 3 products for the price of 2 products, or a frequently requested feature, a percentage off shipping if a specific condition is made in the order. This module will allow you to create promotions that can convert people browsing your site into buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://store.idnovate.com/en/promotions-marketing/1385-promotions-and-discounts-3x2-reductions-offers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>View Module</strong></a></p>
<h3>Cash on Delivery with Fee</h3>
<p>In some countries cash on delivery is a principal way of doing business online. But as more people are converting to online payments, you can subtly penalize the users that still want to choose cash on delivery by charging an extra fee. This module provides you a way to do that. This module does not just allow you to add a fee, you can customize it by either being a flat fee, or a percentage based fee. You can also cap the amount of fee that is charged as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://store.idnovate.com/en/payment/1370-cash-on-delivery-with-fee-surcharge-plus-cod.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>View Module</strong></a></p>
<h3>GDPR Compliance Module</h3>
<p>This module allows your shop to comply with the current GDPR laws in the EU. If you operate a business in the EU it is essential that you comply with GDPR if you want to stay in business. This module allows you to create cookie consent levels for your shop and also allows your customers to withdraw their consent at any time they want, making your shop GDPR compliant on the front end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://store.idnovate.com/en/design-navigation/1393-gdpr-cookies-law-block-third-party-cookies-geoip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>View Module</strong></a></p>
<h3>Whatsapp Live Chat Integration</h3>
<p>Whatsapp is one of the most popular messaging applications in the world. This module allows you to add a Whatsapp chat to your site, where your users can asks questions or get ordering help in real time. This can help in closing sales and providing better customer service to your customers. The module is highly configurable, you can even set your working hours, so the module shows an after hours banner when your shop is closed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://store.idnovate.com/en/customers/1406-whatsapp-live-chat-with-customers-whatsapp-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>View Module</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few of idnovate&#8217;s over 50 modules. If you are looking to expand your shop with new capabilities to try to entice new browsers to become customers check out their whole module store.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have been pretty quiet here lately, I have been so consumed with pushing other areas of thirty bees forward I haven&#8217;t had time to update the blog in a bit. I just wanted to let everyone know things are actually starting to come together and go pretty well with thirty bees. We are planning on making some big changes around our infrastructure pretty soon, as a way to push different parts of our plan in to the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The forum</h2>
<p>The forum is going to change very soon. The last month or so a couple of us have been working on getting a new forum ready to launch, with all of the current post and user information migrated over to the new platform. Right now we are shooting for a weekend launch, so you might find our forum unreachable over the weekend while we are syncing data. Our new forum will allow us to better serve users while being more manageable as well. The main reason we are leaving the current nodebb forum is we have to maintain too much of it. So much of the infrastructure and plugins were half finished and needed to be completed or fixed to be made working. This adds a lot of worry an uncertainty with the forum and keeping it secure. Another issue is that the forum is built on a totally different stack than everything else we use. It requires node, mongo, redis, and solr. Having just a simple lamp or lemp stack will help with maintaining the underlying system of the forum.</p>
<p>Those alone are not the only reasons we wanted to migrate, we also are expanding the functionality of the forum. One of the things that has always bothered me about forums is how content gets lost. Posts like this, https://forum.thirtybees.com/topic/1289/how-to-show-tags-on-products-page  They are very helpful, but they get buried as other people post other tips and tricks. In most forums there is no way to organize topics like these where they do not get buried. That is why with our new forum users will have a blog feed. They will be able to post articles, tips, or how to&#8217;s to their blog where they can always stay organized and be promoted around the site. This helps with the free flow of information, helping users create better, more successful shops.</p>
<p>Another weakness of forums is knowing exactly how someone fits into the forum. One way I wanted to solve this is by adding a product feed to members profiles. Like this user, https://forum.thirtybees.com/user/mediacom87  He has 13 modules in our marketplace. I feel it would be helpful to him, us, and the community if when you went to his profile it showed a feed of his modules. This not only gives seller incentives to list more modules and themes in our marketplace, it also gives them more incentive to post and help users in our forum, by creating more exposure for their products.</p>
<p>There are other features we will be working on for the forum as well, the idea is to create a deeper integration between the systems to make everything more seamless and make people want to participate more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Patreon</h2>
<p>Another thing we have been working on is the Patreon &#8220;situation&#8221;. Several patrons contacted us over the last couple of months that their accounts were banned. We have also had users contact us about wanting to donate, but not with that platform. So we have taken the steps to bring the whole system in house. We are putting the finishing touches on it right now, but the system should be ready to launch in about a week.</p>
<p>The major benefits of bringing it in house are the reduction of fees, while also being able to offer more payment options, and to be able to integrate deeper with our systems. These out weight the time it took to build the integration out. One system we would like to integrate deeper with is the forum. We want to be able to assign flair to our patrons, so everyone knows that you all are the ones that help support thirty bees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Git Updater</h2>
<p>Over the last couple months Markus (@traumflug) has made a lot of progress with the Git Updater. Earlier this week he posted a preview version of the module to the forum, https://forum.thirtybees.com/topic/2441/gitupdater-preview This sparked some great discussion on how we need to handle certain things during the updates and rollbacks. The module is taking some time, but when it is done, it will be a system that no other platform has in terms of flexibility, stability, and reliability. Then we can focus full steam ahead on pushing thirty bees into the future. If you haven&#8217;t already checked the module out, give it a look, give some feedback. This will be the updater that powers updates after the next couple versions. So any feedback on the interface or abilities would be a great help to all of us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are happy today to welcome the newest partner agency to the thirty bees family. Today we welcome Prestalia as our newest partner. Prestalia is a full service development agency based out of San Marino, a small republic landlocked in the middle of Northern Italy. The developers at Prestalia are trained in both front-end and back-end development with thirty bees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Prestalia&#8217;s Modules</h2>
<p>Currently Prestalia has 7 modules on the the thirty bees store for sale. Below is a list of their most popular modules.</p>
<h3>Amazon Sync Module</h3>
<p>The Amazon sync module does just that. It lets you sync your store&#8217;s products to Amazon while also bringing the orders from Amazon over to your shop. The module syncs information both ways so you can manage your Amazon selling account from the back office of your thirty bees site.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://store.thirtybees.com/shop-modules/administration/module-amazon-sync"><strong>View Module</strong></a></p>

<p>FastBay will allow you to sync your whole shop with eBay in a matter of minutes.

<h3>Orders ++</h3>
<p>The Orders ++ module is a back office modification module allows you to view more information about your orders by using their custom order list. You can see the shipping address, the products from the order, and the carrier from a heads up view without clicking into the actual order. This saves a ton of time in managing the orders in your shop.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past several years e-commerce has taken a shift and started to change. One of the big changes that we have seen is the newer payment methods that sites are supporting. Years ago Overstock.com started the trend by accepting Bitcoin for transactions on their site. Since then it has spiraled into some of the largest retailers such as Expedia, Newegg, Microsoft, CheapAir, and hundreds more. No longer are coin based payments in the shadows, they have been embraced by some of the largest companies in the world. Have you started accepting coin based payments yet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Start Accepting Coin Payments</h2>
<p>This is where CoinGate comes in. Using CoinGate you can start accepting payments from over 50 different crypto currencies. You can start accepting the most popular coins such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Monero, Litecoin, and many more. This widens the market of your potential customers, while having virtually no downside to you, the merchant. There is no monthly fee associated with having Coingate on your site, the module is free. Also, the processing fee is lower than any other major card processing company at just <strong>1% per transaction</strong>. These are some of the main reasons you should consider accepting crypto currency coin payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Lower Fraud Rates</h2>
<p>Consider this, with a typical payment on your website through a major card processor, there is always the fraud risk. Customers can charge back payments made to your site, lie, claim they did not receive the goods, and you are out the cost of the goods. Charge back fraud is one of the quickest growing fraud types in the world, coupled with identity theft based frauds your shop can be heavily exposed. This is especially true if your shop sells high risk goods.</p>
<p>With crypto currencies there are no charge backs. Once the money has been sent to you, it is yours. It is up to YOUR discretion as to ever refund a customer. There is no one for a customer to complain to, to get a transaction reversed, it is simply impossible with crypto currencies. This makes crypto currencies very attractive for merchants, where some even offer special discounts for using them for purchases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But Who Uses Crypto Currencies</h2>
<p>The statistics of who uses crypto currency might be surprising, at the same time they might also be your target demographic. From a study of users on Reddit, the average user of crypto currency is a male, between the age 21-35, with a college degree. With the vast majority of them making their first crypto currency purchase in 2017 or later. This means that the market is steadily growing and could be your target demographic. What better way to test the waters with little to know investment costs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Setting up the Coingate Module</h2>
<p>Setting up the Coingate module is simple and easy. All you have to do is download the module from the thirty bees Marketplace, then install it in the back of your shop. Once you install the module you will need to enter your API information in the module and you are ready to start taking crypto currency payments. That is quick and painless, while at the same time you open yourself to new markets, with more secure payments and less fraud. This is a win-win situation.</p>
